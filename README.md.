# Week1-StudentPerformance-EDA

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a student performance dataset, focusing on features like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course.

## Dataset
The dataset contains scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and preparation data.

## Analysis Steps
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. Explored data structure and checked for missing values.
3. Analyzed score patterns by grouping features.
4. Visualized data with bar plots and histograms.
5. Summarized insights on student performance.

## Key Insights
- Students completing test preparation course scored higher on average.
- Parental education level strongly correlates with higher scores.
- Gender differences in math scores were observed.
- Lunch type correlates with test performance, hinting at socioeconomic factors.

## How to Run
- Open the `Week1-StudentPerformance-EDA.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Ensure all libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib are installed.
- Run all cells sequentially to reproduce analysis and visualizations.
